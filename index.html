      <h3>History of Agriculture</h3>
      The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago.<br />
      After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago,<br />
      nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago.<br />Pigs,
      sheep, goats, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago.<br />Plants
      were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world.<br />Industrial
      agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came
      to dominate agricultural output,<br />
      though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence
      agriculture.<br />

      <h2>Agricultural development</h2>
      <p>
        The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many <br>
        times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering. <br>
        Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and <br>
        included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centers of <br>
        origin.Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 <br>
        years ago. In the Paleolithic Levant, 23,000 years ago, cereals <br>
        cultivation of emmer, barley, and oats has been observed near the sea of <br>
        Galilee. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 <br>
        BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by <br>
        mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia <br>
        between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from <br>
        the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 <br>
        years ago. Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East <br>
        Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated <br>
        about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato <br>
        was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, <br>
        coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some root <br>
        vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. <br>
        Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years <br>
        ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago <br>
